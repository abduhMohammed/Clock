# Clock
This project demonstrates a simple analog clock implemented using OpenGL and C++.

Features:
- Real-time display: The clock updates in real-time, accurately displaying the current hour, minute, and second.
- Clean and organized code: The code is well-structured with clear function definitions and comments for better readability and maintainability.

- Basic clock elements:
    Clock face with hour markers.
    Hour, minute, and second hands.
    Basic styling for the clock elements.

How to run:
1 - Compile:
        Bash
        g++ -o clock clock.cpp -lGL -lGLU -lglut 
2 - Run:
    Bash
    ./clock

To use this code:
1 - Save: Save the code as clock.cpp.
2 - Compile and run: Follow the instructions above.

Customization:
    Appearance: Modify the colors, font size, hand thickness, and other visual aspects of the clock in the code.
    
    Functionality: Add features like a digital time display, alarm functionality, or different clock styles.

Note:
    This project requires the OpenGL, GLUT, and GLU libraries. Make sure they are installed on your system. 
    
    This is a basic example, and there is room for significant improvement and expansion.
